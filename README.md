To set up a pipeline that copies files from GitHub to a remote repository after a user merges to the master branch, you can use a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.

I'll provide an example using GitHub Actions, which is directly integrated with GitHub. The idea is to trigger an action when a pull request is merged to master, and then copy the files to a remote server via SSH.

Steps to Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow:
Create an SSH Key Pair:

Generate an SSH key on your local machine to securely connect to the remote server.
bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Add the public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server.
Store the private key (~/.ssh/id_rsa) as a GitHub secret.
Add Secrets to GitHub:

Go to your repository's Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.
Add two secrets:
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY – the private key from the SSH key pair.
REMOTE_HOST – the hostname or IP address of the remote server.
REMOTE_USER – the username on the remote server.
REMOTE_PATH – the path to copy the files on the remote server.
Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:

Inside your repository, create a directory .github/workflows.
Add a new YAML file, e.g., deploy.yml, to define the workflow.
Here’s an example GitHub Actions workflow to copy files after a merge to master:

yaml
Copy code
name: Deploy Files to Remote Server

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Setup SSH and copy files
      - name: Copy files to remote server
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v0.1.8
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          script: |
            mkdir -p ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PATH }}
            rsync -avz ./ ${{ secrets.REMOTE_USER }}@${{ secrets.REMOTE_HOST }}:${{ secrets.REMOTE_PATH }}
